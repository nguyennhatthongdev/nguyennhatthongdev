> WORKING EXPERIENCE

- I have experience working with Vue.js for 2 years and have used many popular libraries and tools for web application development such as Vee validate, ant design vue, axios, vuex, pinia, and lodash-es.

- I have 12 months of experience working with Angular 11, where I have utilized popular libraries and tools such as RxJS, ng zorro antd, Formly, and ngx permissions. RxJS enabled me to implement reactive programming, ng-zorro-antd provided a rich set of UI components, Formly allowed me to create dynamic forms, and ngx permissions helped me manage user permissions in Angular applications.

- I have the opportunity to work with CanvasJS for around 4 months, where I have utilized it to create a calendar KPI for measuring performance and effort over a period of time or available capacity. This project has provided me with valuable experience in data visualization and enabled me to leverage the powerful capabilities of CanvasJS to create effective and engaging visualizations.
